## 1. Introduction

Fluffernut is an AI-powered tool designed to automate cryptocurrency chart analysis. It fetches real-time cryptocurrency data, visualizes it in charts, and provides technical analysis using indicators like Simple Moving Averages (SMA) to help you identify trends like Golden Crosses. Fluffernut can be customized and extended for various use cases, from automated trading to monitoring crypto market conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Pulls OHLCV data from supported exchanges (e.g., Binance).
- **Charting**: Visualizes data with customizable charts.
- **Simple Technical Analysis**: Golden Cross, moving averages, and more.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Regular updates with analysis and visual feedback.

## 2. Installation Guide

To get started with Fluffernut, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the Fluffernut repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluffernut.git
cd fluffernut
```


## 2. Install Dependencies
- Fluffernut requires a few Python libraries. Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install ccxt pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## 3. Configure Your API Keys
Fluffernut interacts with cryptocurrency exchanges (like Binance) via APIs. You may need to configure your API keys for secure data access:

Store the API keys in a .env file or pass them as arguments when running the code.

## 4. Run the Script
To start monitoring cryptocurrency data and visualizing charts, simply run the script:
```bash
python fluffernut.py
```
## 3. Core API Functions
1. fetch_crypto_data(symbol, timeframe='1h', limit=100)
Fetches OHLCV data for a given cryptocurrency symbol from the exchange.

Parameters:
symbol (str): The cryptocurrency pair to monitor (e.g., 'BTC/USDT').
timeframe (str, optional): The time interval between each data point (e.g., '1m', '1h', '1d'). Default is '1h'.
limit (int, optional): The number of data points to fetch. Default is 100.
Returns:
Pandas DataFrame containing columns timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume.
Example:
python
Copy code
data = fetch_crypto_data('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=200)
2. plot_chart(data, symbol)
Visualizes the cryptocurrency data with price and moving averages.

Parameters:
data (Pandas DataFrame): The data to plot.
symbol (str): The cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., 'BTC/USDT').
Returns:
Displays a plot of the cryptocurrency’s closing price and moving averages.
Example:
python
Copy code
plot_chart(data, 'BTC/USDT')
3. simple_analysis(data)
Performs a basic technical analysis of the cryptocurrency data, checking for a Golden Cross.

Parameters:
data (Pandas DataFrame): The cryptocurrency data to analyze.
Returns:
Prints out whether a Golden Cross (potential buy signal) has occurred based on the 50-period and 200-period Simple Moving Averages.
Example:
python
Copy code
simple_analysis(data)
4. fluffernut_automated_alert(symbol)
Starts the automated monitoring system. Fluffernut will fetch data at regular intervals and perform analysis.

Parameters:
symbol (str): The cryptocurrency pair to monitor (e.g., 'BTC/USDT').
Returns:
Continuously fetches new data, performs analysis, and displays visual feedback.
Example:
python
Copy code
fluffernut_automated_alert('BTC/USDT')
4. Customization and Extensions
Fluffernut is designed to be easily customizable. You can extend its functionality by modifying or adding the following:

1. Adding More Indicators:
To implement more advanced indicators like RSI, MACD, or Bollinger Bands, you can write additional functions that process the data DataFrame. For example:

python
Copy code
def add_rsi(data, period=14):
    delta = data['close'].diff(1)
    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)
    
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=period).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=period).mean()
    
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    data['RSI'] = rsi
    return data
2. Automated Trading:
You can integrate Fluffernut with the exchange API (via ccxt) to execute buy/sell orders based on specific signals such as Golden Cross. For example:

python
Copy code
def execute_trade(symbol, action='buy', quantity=0.01):
    if action == 'buy':
        exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, quantity)
    elif action == 'sell':
        exchange.create_market_sell_order(symbol, quantity)
Make sure to configure your exchange API keys properly to execute trades safely.

3. Adding Notifications:
Fluffernut can be extended to send notifications (via email, SMS, or Slack) when certain market conditions are met (e.g., Golden Cross detected). Here's an example of sending a Slack message:

python
Copy code
import requests

def send_slack_message(message):
    webhook_url = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url'
    payload = {'text': message}
    requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
You can call send_slack_message('Golden Cross detected!') within the simple_analysis() function when a buy signal is detected.

5. Use Case Examples
Example 1: Monitoring BTC/USDT with Automated Alerts
To start monitoring Bitcoin against USDT with Fluffernut:

python
Copy code
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'
fluffernut_automated_alert(symbol)
Fluffernut will fetch data every 10 minutes, display price charts, and check for a Golden Cross.

Example 2: Visualize Crypto Data
To visualize Ethereum data and apply a 50-period and 200-period SMA:

python
Copy code
data = fetch_crypto_data('ETH/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=100)
plot_chart(data, 'ETH/USDT')
simple_analysis(data)
This will fetch the data, plot the chart, and provide a Golden Cross signal.

6. FAQ
Q: How can I change the interval for data fetching?
You can modify the time.sleep() value inside the fluffernut_automated_alert() function to fetch data at different intervals. For example, change time.sleep(600) (10 minutes) to time.sleep(300) (5 minutes).

Q: Can I integrate Fluffernut with a live trading account?
Yes, you can integrate Fluffernut with your exchange’s API (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) to place buy/sell orders automatically when certain signals (like Golden Cross) are detected. Be sure to test this with small amounts or in a sandbox environment first.
